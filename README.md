**Web Scraping and Data Presentation**

This project involves web scraping data from the Rotten Tomatoes website to extract information about movies available for streaming at home. The data to be extracted includes the movie name, Tomatometer ratings, and Audience Scores. The scraped data will then be organized into a structured table format for further analysis.
